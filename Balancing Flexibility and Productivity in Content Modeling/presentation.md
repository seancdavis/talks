Everyone hates their CMS

Maybe it's not the CMS's fault.

Theory: Clients who love their CMS experience either 1) don't use it, or 2) haven't used it.

Problem: The perfect CMS experience differs widely from user to user. Folks with no technical background aren't going to use a markdown CMS, while that's perfectly fine for many of us. I consider GitHub to be a great CMS.

And in-context editing is reallly difficult to achieve and maintain. And it doesn't solve for every scenario.

Shout out: Stackbit and Tina.

So we end up in this place in which it becomes extremely difficult to be productive because to cater the CMS experience to the primary users means building something custom every friggin' time.

Theory: By building a front end that accounts for maximum flexibility, we can build a CMS experience that is customized to our editors, while being consistent for our developers.

Problems with headless world:

- Cost modeling makes it difficult to pin down what you're going to spend
- Your approach has a direct impact on billing.

Let' talk about how we can build an experience that puts you in control and gives you the power to weigh your options and make the right decision.

The difference between structured and flexible content.

structured in blog posts. fields map to specific areas on the page.

flexible has an open field and you can write any HTML in there.

Maybe we want to be in the middle somewhere.

The typical marketing website.

- HOme page
- Basic content pages (about, etc.)
- Contact page
- Blog posts

## How do we normally build this sort of thing?

Explaining the technical theory on the front end.

- templates
- components

components

- transformers
- mappers

Build the most flexible page as your base. This thing exists in every project.

Expose that in the CMS _if necessary_.

Then, get more structured.

Examples on how this looks in practice.
