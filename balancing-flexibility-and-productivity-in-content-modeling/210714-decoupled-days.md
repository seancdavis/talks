# Ultimate Flexibility

![inline fit](images/weird-sandwich.jpg)

![right fit](images/design--home-page--blurred.png)

^ Like a sandwich you make in your own kitchen. You can do whatever you want. But you have to decide and you have to do the work. Like peanut butter and mayonnaise, Grandma White.

[.header: #000000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# When you choose **flexibility**,<br>your content editors can<br>**do whatever they want**, but it **requires technical knowledge** and (usually) **isn't productive**.

![right fit](images/design--home-page--blurred.png)

^ Like a sandwich you buy in a deli. I have this local deli that has dozens of options, but it names every ingredient that will go on the sandwich ahead of time. Like a reuben. I say "Reuben" and I know what to expect.

# When you choose **productivity**, content editors can **move fast**,<br>but they are stuck to a<br>**specific implementation**.

# [fit] The key is to find<br>the perfect **balance** of<br>**flexibility** and **productivity**.

^ We know we want to find a balance in here, but how do we do that?

# Two (of many) **best practices** when building websites today ...

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# [fit] 1. Use a Component-Based Framework

<br>

![inline fit](../_assets/logo/react-logo.png)![inline fit 25%](../_assets/logo/nextjs-logo.png)![inline fit 30%](../_assets/logo/gatsby-logo.png)

<br>

![inline fit](../_assets/logo/vuejs-logo.png)![inline fit 40%](../_assets/logo/nuxtjs-logo.png)![inline fit](../_assets/logo/eleventy-logo.png)

^ We build websites with components these days (server or client) to reduce duplicated code. Thinking of a website in terms of a global system makes it easier to add and edit over time.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# [fit] 2. Separate Content from Presentation

![inline](images/210608--content-drive--after--transparent.png)

^ Separating content from presentation (no need to have a cms with _ultimate_ flexibility. that's what code is for)

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-yellow-twitter.png)

[.header: #051C28, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# We can apply those same<br>principles to our CMS.

^ How do those practices translate to the CMS?

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-orange-twitter.png)

[.header: #261000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# Let's break our home page up into **_reusable_ components**.

---

![original fit](images/home-page-components.png)

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-lime-twitter.png)

[.header: #000000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# How might we **extract the content** so that we can **deliver** it to the code?

---

Maybe this is just a JSON representation of the content we want to store as data.

(I don't know if this is right yet)

```json
{
  "jumbotron": {
    "title": "Free Sandwiches for Everyone!",
    "body": "We are a non-profit organization solely dedicated to ensuring everyone gets a free sandwich.",
    "image": "sandwich.svg",
    "button": {
      "label": "Get Involved!",
      "url": "/contact"
    }
  },
  "card_group" ...
}
```

[.header: #1B3846, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# How do we model this content?

^ Modeling affects cost many times.

---

Three methods:

^ Say you have a generic Page model ...

---

1. New model for each component with associations

Screenshot with Contentful, or maybe that's a new slide

---

2. Conditional fields

^ Which CMS does this well?

---

3. Modular content

Forestry

---

The Ultimately Flexible Page!

^ Once you have a pattern for components you have the ultimately flexible page (i.e. a Page model)

---

Show this in action -- title, meta, and components fields

---

Back to the front end

---

Graphic of the data flow.

^ Walk through the flow. It should include mappers and transformers

---

Zoom in and elaborate on mappers.

Code sample may help, too.

---

Zoom in and elaborate on transformers.

Code sample may help, too.

---

Using this approach, you can build the ultimately flexible page on the front-end.

---

Clean hands (our work is done, right?)

---

Still, that's not super productive for content editors. (Don't want to add a series of components for every blog post.)

---

Introducing Templates

^ Create new page type or model with repeatable patterns. Think: blog posts, generic content pages, etc.

---

Example of CMS fields for a rigid type, like a blog post

^ Templates streamline the flexible page by introducing _some_ amount of rigidity (i.e. productivity)

---

This translates to the front end

(Show code snippet)

---

Also gives you the ability to make it easier to add specific styling to some template (exceptions to global patterns).

---

Benefits ...

---

B #1: It enables you to scale down complexity to perfectly align with your editors' technical abilities

---

B #2: You already have a base engine in place on every project. All you have to do is define the components and decide where you want to introduce templates to help your editors, because templates in the code are still built on top of the flexible page.

---

Recap ...

---

Start with a flexible base that pulls data from the CMS, transforms it, then maps it to frontnd components.

---

Use templates to introduce specific rules and/or styles to help content editors

---

Consider cost of the CMS you're using when choosing how to implement components.
