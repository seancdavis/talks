# Ultimate Flexibility

![original](../_assets/background/bg-grey.png)

![inline fit](images/weird-sandwich.jpg)

![right fit](images/design--home-page--blurred.png)

^ Like a sandwich you make in your own kitchen. You can do whatever you want. But you have to decide and you have to do the work. Like peanut butter and mayonnaise, Grandma White.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-lime-twitter.png)

[.header: #000000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# When you choose **flexibility**,<br>your content editors can<br>**do whatever they want**, but it **requires technical knowledge** and (usually) **isn't productive**.

---

## Ultimate Productivity

## Ultimate Productivity

![original](../_assets/background/bg-grey.png)

![inline fit](images/deli-sandwich.jpg)

![right fit](images/design--home-page--blurred.png)

^ Like a sandwich you buy in a deli. I have this local deli that has dozens of options, but it names every ingredient that will go on the sandwich ahead of time. Like a reuben. I say "Reuben" and I know what to expect.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-pink-twitter.png)

[.header: #1B3846, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# When you choose **productivity**, content editors can **move fast**,<br>but they are stuck to a<br>**specific implementation**.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-shapes.png)

[.header: #000000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# [fit] The key is to find<br>the perfect **balance** of<br>**flexibility** and **productivity**.

^ We know we want to find a balance in here, but how do we do that?

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-green-twitter.png)

[.header: #FFFFFF, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# Now we can make<br>our developers happy!

### (Finally.)

^ The coolest people ever. Our rockstars. Overselling it?

# Two (of many) **best practices** when building websites today ...

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# [fit] 1. Use a Component-Based Framework

<br>

<br>

![inline fit](../_assets/logo/vuejs-logo.png)![inline fit 40%](../_assets/logo/nuxtjs-logo.png)![inline fit](../_assets/logo/eleventy-logo.png)

^ We build websites with components these days (server or client) to reduce duplicated code. Thinking of a website in terms of a global system makes it easier to add and edit over time.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# [fit] 2. Separate Content from Presentation

![inline](images/210608--content-drive--after--transparent.png)

^ Separating content from presentation (no need to have a cms with _ultimate_ flexibility. that's what code is for)

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-yellow-twitter.png)

[.header: #051C28, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# We can apply those same<br>principles to our CMS.

^ How do those practices translate to the CMS?

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-orange-twitter.png)

[.header: #261000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# Let's break our home page up into **_reusable_ components**.

---

![original fit](images/home-page-components.png)

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-lime-twitter.png)

[.header: #000000, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# How might we **extract the content** so that we can **deliver** it to the code?

---

Show code here and then come back to it later when talking about transformers and mappers.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-pink-twitter.png)

[.header: #1B3846, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# How do we **structure** (or _model_)<br>this content in a **CMS**?

NOTE: I think this should be more about applying "the ultimately flexible page" to "building with components" and how that can be modeled.

^ Modeling affects cost many times.

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

#### _Option #1_

## [fit] Associated<br>Component Records

![right 40%](images/210710-associated-components--page-only.png)

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

![inline](images/210710-associated-components.png)

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

#### _Option #2_

## [fit] Embedded<br>Component Fields

![right fit](images/210710-embedded-components.png)

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# Comparing the Options

[.column]

### Associated Records

- Reusability
- Pricing tier limitations
- Unlimited nestable layers

[.column]

### Embedded Fields

- Works well with git-based CMS
- All page content in one place
- Lower cost
- CMS limitations

---

<!-- ![original](../_assets/background/bg-green-twitter.png) -->

<!-- [.header: #FFFFFF, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)] -->

This should be a sentence on how cost, CMS choices, and content modeling are all inter-dependent on one another.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blank.png)

# CMS Hack: Conditional Fields

![inline](images/210710-conditional-fields.png)

^ Which CMS does this well?

^ I think ... remove this one and focus on storing content as whether it should be attached to the page or associated with it. And that it usually is a result of 1) CMS capabilities, and 2) cost (cost is often associated with number of records or models)

^ Or ... maybe this is an option that comes after as its own sort of thing. As a way to get around cost. Technically conditional fields could be used with either method (embedded or associated), but it's not a great practice if it can be avoided.

---

![original](../_assets/background/bg-blue-twitter.png)

[.header: #FFFFFF, Source Serif Pro, alignment(center)]

# With a _flexible_ page model in place, we can **build the front end**, maintaining _parity_ with **the CMS**.

# Button Transformer

# Button Mapper

# Using _transformers_ and _mappers_, you can build **the ultimately flexible page** on the front end.

# **_Hooray!_**

## We're all done!

## Right?

![right](images/snow-white-happy.gif)

---

Still, that's not super productive for content editors. (Don't want to add a series of components for every blog post.)

---

Introducing Templates

^ Create new page type or model with repeatable patterns. Think: blog posts, generic content pages, etc.

---

Example of CMS fields for a rigid type, like a blog post

^ Templates streamline the flexible page by introducing _some_ amount of rigidity (i.e. productivity)

---

This translates to the front end

(Show code snippet)

---

Also gives you the ability to make it easier to add specific styling to some template (exceptions to global patterns).

---

Benefits ...

---

B #1: It enables you to scale down complexity to perfectly align with your editors' technical abilities

---

B #2: You already have a base engine in place on every project. All you have to do is define the components and decide where you want to introduce templates to help your editors, because templates in the code are still built on top of the flexible page.

---

Recap ...

---

Start with a flexible base that pulls data from the CMS, transforms it, then maps it to frontnd components.

---

Use templates to introduce specific rules and/or styles to help content editors

---

Consider cost of the CMS you're using when choosing how to implement components.
