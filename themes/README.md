# Sean C Davis Talk Themes

This directory contains theming files for the various talks I give. Each theme is contained within its own subdirectory, and typically includes:

- Theme file to import into Deckset
- Source artwork file
- Shared assets for that theme
- Text snippets (reusable styles, backgrounds, etc.)

If the theme varies in some way from this, there will be a README file in that directory with the necessary details.
