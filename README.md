# Sean C Davis's Talks

Why, hello there!

I'm [Sean C Davis](https://www.seancdavis.com/) and I like to talk. These are the source files, supporting assets, and demo code for the talks I've given. I use them in conjunction with [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/), which is why the presentation files look a little goofy.

## Available for Talks

I'm likely available to speak at your event, join you on your podcast, host a workshop, etc.

I can speak or teach on any of the subjects you see here, or many other subjects in the wide world of web development. For some examples, check out the [`talks` directory](./talks).

For inquiries, get the conversation started [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29) or [by email](mailto:sean@stackbit.com).

## Repo Organization

I've arranged this project as a monorepo so I could keep everything related to my talks in one place, including demo code. Each of the top-level directories contains a README file with more information about its contents.

## Shout Out!

Big shout-out to [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) for [the inspiration](https://github.com/cassidoo/talks) to pull talks together like this.
