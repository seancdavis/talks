# Talks

Why, hello there!

I'm [Sean C Davis](https://www.seancdavis.com/) and I like to talk. These are the source files for the talks I've given. I use them in conjunction with [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com/), which is why they look a little goofy.

Wanna talk about me talking? [Say hello on Twitter](https://twitter.com/seancdavis29)!

Big shout-out to [@cassidoo](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) for [the inspiration](https://github.com/cassidoo/talks) to pull talks together like this.
