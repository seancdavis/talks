Our front ends are built to serve our back-ends

Introducing _The Middle_

---

Middle End?

Middle Middle?

The. Middle.

(Jimmy Eat World)

---

Sketch / how it works

---

How the middle Works:

1. Retrieves data from API (back end)
1. Transforms and normalizes data for the front end
1. Makes data available to the front end

---

In an abstracted state, you can add "drivers" (i.e. plugins) to support new APIs.

---

Two approaches:

1. Write to file.
1. Deliver in real-time as an API.

---

Benefits:

1. Front and back can do their own thing.
1. Front ends can be built consistently regardless of the source.

---

Thank you!
